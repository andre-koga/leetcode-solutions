My solutions for some LeetCode problems. These are my own solutions, but some of them might rely on hints or partial explanations.

Most of the solutions are written in Java or Python.

Notable original solutions:

- [22 - Generate Parenthesis](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/22-generate-parenthesis.py), since it uses a very clever and lazy approach to the pattern of writing parenthesis
- [39 - Combination Sum](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/39-combination-sum.py), beats 99% of submissions with an original solution using a temporary "options" array
- [55 - Jump Game](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/55-jump-game.py), has a two-pointer intuitive and original approach that beats ~90% of solutions
