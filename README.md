Solutions for LeetCode problems listed on the website. These are my own solutions, but some of them might rely on hints or explanations found on the website!

Most of the solutions are written in Java or Python.

Notable original solutions:

- [22 - Generate Parenthesis](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/022-generate-parenthesis.py), since it uses a very clever and lazy approach to the pattern of writing parenthesis
- [39 - Combination Sum](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/039-combination-sum.py), beats 99% of submissions with an original solution using a temporary "options" array
