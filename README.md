My solutions for some LeetCode problems. These are my own solutions, but some of them might rely on hints or partial explanations.

Most of the solutions are written in Python3.

Notable original solutions:

- [22 - Generate Parenthesis](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/0022-generate-parenthesis.py), since it uses a very clever and lazy approach to the pattern of writing parenthesis
- [39 - Combination Sum](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/0039-combination-sum.py), beats 99% of submissions with an original solution using a temporary "options" array
- [42 - Trapping Rain Water](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/0042-trapping-rain-water.py), my solution isn't completely original but I loved this problem, so here it is.
- [49 - Group Anagrams](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/0049-group-anagrams.py), beats 98% of submissions with a lengthy but creative solution involving prime numbers
- [55 - Jump Game](https://github.com/andre-koga/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/solutions/0055-jump-game.py), has a two-pointer intuitive and original approach that beats ~90% of solutions
